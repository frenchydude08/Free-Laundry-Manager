# Free-Laundry-Manager
Management and access control system for laundry equipment in small apartment-buildings and shared-flats.

The aim of this repo is to devellop a control and management system for a shared small-size laundry of one washing machine, and one dryer.
With this system, landlords and co-owners can provide fair and monitored access to a set of normal home appliances.


This system is not for comercial use, and as such does not provide any waranty what so ever and of any type.

The philosophy of this project is to improve the life of people, and to optimize the sharing of available resources, like laundry equipment. See it as a laundrypooling solution!

DANGER!! The realisation of this project involves the cabling and routing of mains power high-voltages.
Electrical equipment should be installed, operated, serviced, and maintained only by qualified personnel.
No responsibility is assumed by the writer and co-writers for any consequences arising out of the use of this project and equipment.
A qualified person is one who has skills and knowledge related to the construction, installation, and operation of electrical equipment and has received safety training to recognize and avoid the hazards involved.
